# Operators and Loops
## Expressions and Operators
- JS has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator
- A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator
- A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator

## Loops
- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly
- There are different kinds of loops but they essentially do the same thing: repeat and action some number of times

#### For statement
- A FOR statement repeats until something evaluates to false

#### While statement
- A WHILE statement executes its statement as long as a specified condition evaluates to TRUE
