# Growth Mindset
#### The growth mindset means slowing down the process of something that is challenging you and trying to learn why it is challenging, what are the obstacles in your way from achieveing your desired result, and how you can overcome those obstacles. In the long run, using the growth mindset will help you learn more about yourself, help you to see things in a positive light, and help you overcome and achieve things that you really want to!

## Reminders for having a growth mindset
- Slow Down the process, take a step back and analyze the situation
- Figure out what the end goals are, the obstacles in my way, and how to get past those obtacles to acheive the result I want
- Don't take the easy way out, learn from past/current mistakes and the end result will be even better
