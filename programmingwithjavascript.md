# Programming With JavaScript

## Functions
- Functions are one of the fundamental things in JavaScript. A function is similar to a procedure; a set up statements that performs a task or calculates input and return an output
- To use a function, define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it

### Defining functions
- A function definition consists of:
    - the function keyword followed by:
        - The name of the function
        - A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas
        - The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets

## Control Flow
- The *control flow* is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless there are structures in place that change the control flow
    - e.g. conditions and loops
- A typical script in JS includes many control structures:
    - conditionals
    - loops
    - functions
