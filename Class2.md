## **Choosing a text editor**
### What is a text editor?
* A text editor is something you download and install on your computer that is accessed through your web browser
* A great feature of any text editor is "code completion". Code completion helps to save time while you work but giving suggestions based on what you type.
* Another great feature is called "Emmett". This is a shorthand language that allows you to work a lot faster when typing in HTML or CSS.
* There are a lot of different text editors you can use for your computer. Some are better than others and you can play around to see what works best for you.
