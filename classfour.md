# Wireframing and why it is important
Wireframing is important because it helps to outline what you want to do with your project. It shows you how it ebbs and flows before getting stuck in it. It is a way to plan and design all the different aspects of the website/app.
It is also a great way to show how the user will be able to interact with the website/app so you know if it will be a smooth experience or not.
## Steps to take when wireframing
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
